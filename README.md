# FooBarQix
Python program dedicated to the FooBarQix kata (http://codingdojo.org/kata/FooBarQix).

The program currently solely consists in one module representing the FooBarQix model, which is still to be implemented, and its unit tests. It is possible to execute the doctests of the `model` module by entering: `python -m doctest model.py`; and the unit tests by entering: `python -m unittest`. However at this point the tests should fail because of the lack of implementation.
